* 1/2 tsp Kosher salt Add more to taste
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1/8 tsp oregano
* 6 cups water
* 1 tsp chicken bullion powder

## Directions
1. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a medium or large pot. Add the onions and saute over medium heat about 4 to 5 minutes.
2. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.
3. Add the tomato and cook for 4 minutes or until they're soft.
4. Add the potatoes and salt, pepper and oregano. Mix well and cook for 3 minutes.
5. Add the water, chicken bullion and cilantro. Cover the pot with a lid and cook until the potatoes are cooked through. About 25 to 30 minutes.
6. When the potatoes are ready, add the chile strips and cook for 3 minutes. Add the warm milk and the cheese.
7. Cook for about 5 minutes and remove the bunch of cilantro. Taste for salt & pepper to see if it needs more.
