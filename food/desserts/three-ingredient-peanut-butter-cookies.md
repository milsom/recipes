# 3-Ingredient Peanut Butter Cookies

## Ingredients
* 1 cup smooth peanut butter (well-stirred if using natural peanut butter)
* 3/4 cup granulated sugar
* 1 large egg


## Directions
1. Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat the oven to 350â„‰. Lined 2 rimmed baking sheets with silicone baking mats.
2. Place peanut butter, sugar, and egg in a large bowl. Mix with a flexible spatula until well-combined.
3. Scoop the dough out into 24 (level 1-tablespoon) portions. Roll into balls. Place the dough balls at least 2 inches apart on the baking sheets, 12 per sheet. Flatten each dough ball with a fork until about 2 inches wide and 1/4-inch thick, creating a crosshatch pattern.
4. Bake for 5 minutes. Rotate the baking sheets between racks and from front to back. Bake until the centers are set, the cookies are lightly puffed, and the edges are firm, 5 to 7 minutes more (or more for less chewy cookies). Let cool completely on the baking sheets, about 30 minutes. The cookies will firm up as they cool.
