# Oven-Roasted Chicken Thighs With Carrots and Yukon Gold Potatoes

## Ingredients
* 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 6 large chicken thighs with skin and bones (preferably organic; about 2 1/4 pounds total)
* 1 tablespoon coarse kosher salt
* 2 teaspoons dried thyme
* 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated or ground nutmeg

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 450°F (400 convection). Coat large rimmed baking sheet with 1 tablespoon oil. Place chicken on baking sheet. Turn to coat with oil and set skin side up. Mix salt, thyme, 1½ teaspoons pepper, and nutmeg in small bowl. Sprinkle half of mixture over chicken. Roast until chicken starts to brown and some fat has rendered, about 30 minutes.
2. Meanwhile, combine potatoes, carrots, 2 tablespoons oil, and remaining saltthyme mixture in large bowl. Transfer thighs to medium bowl; set aside. Transfer potato-carrot mixture to same baking sheet; turn to coat with drippings. Roast until vegetables soften, 30 minutes. Place thighs on vegetables; pour accumulated juices from chicken over.
