# Miso Butter Noodles

## Ingredients
* 6 tablespoons salted butter, cut into 1-tablespoon pieces, room temperature
* 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons white miso OR red miso
* 1 small garlic clove, finely grated
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 4 scallions, thinly sliced, whites and greens reserved separately
* Kosher salt and ground black pepper
* 1 pound spaghetti or linguine
* Chopped toasted walnuts, to serve


## Directions
1. In a large pot, bring 4 quarts water to a boil. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, using a spatula, mash and stir the butter, miso, garlic, lemon juice, scallion whites and ¼ teaspoon pepper.
2. To the boiling water, add the pasta and 1 tablespoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Reserve about ½ cup of the pasta water, then drain. Immediately add the pasta to the butter-miso mixture, along with ¼ cup of the reserved pasta water. Toss vigorously, adding more pasta water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if needed, until lightly sauced; there should not be any liquid pooled in the bowl. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve sprinkled with the scallion greens and walnuts.
3. Optional garnish: Finely grated Parmesan cheese OR furikake OR chili crisp
