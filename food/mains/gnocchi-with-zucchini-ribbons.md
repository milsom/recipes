# Gnocchi with Zucchini Ribbons & Parsley Brown Butter

## Ingredients
* 1 pound fresh or frozen gnocchi
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 medium shallots, chopped
* 1 pound zucchini, (about 3 small), very thinly sliced lengthwise with a vegetable peeler or a mandoline slicer
* 1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg
* Freshly ground pepper, to taste
* 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley


## Directions
1. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Cook gnocchi until they float, 3 to 5 minutes or according to package directions. Drain.

2. Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook until the butter is beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add shallots and zucchini and cook, stirring often, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomatoes, salt, nutmeg and pepper and continue cooking, stirring often, until the tomatoes are just starting to break down, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in Parmesan and parsley. Add the gnocchi and toss to coat. Serve immediately.
