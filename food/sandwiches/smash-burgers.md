# Smash Burgers

## Ingredients
Meat
* 4 ounces (110g) freshly ground beef chuck, divided into two 2-ounce (55g) balls
* American Cheese
* Buns

Onions
* Sliced Yellow Onion
* Oil
* Salt 
* Pepper
* Vermouth

Sauce
* Mayo
* Ketchup
* Mustard
* Diced Dill Pickle
* Salt 
* Pepper


## Directions
Sauce
1. In a bowl, add some mayo and ketchup at 2:1 ratio
2. Add mustard, diced dill pickles, salt and pepper
3. Mix
4. Adjust to taste

Onions
1. Melt butter in pan
2. Add onions
3. Cook until softened and translucent
4. Add Salt and pepper
5. When looking almost perfect, add a few splashes of vermouth

Assembly
1. Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.
2. Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure and parchment paper to avoid sticking. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.
3. Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.
4. Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.

*These burgers cook very fast, so it's best to make them one at a time. If making multiple burgers, keep them warm under a tent of foil while preparing subsequent burgers.*
