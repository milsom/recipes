# No Knead Cinnamon Raisin Bread

## Ingredients
* 3 cups all-purpose flour plus more for working with the dough
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast
* 1 tablespooon cinnamon
* 1 cup raisins
* 1 1/2 cups lukewarm water (105-115 F)
* 3 tablespoons brown sugar

## Directions
1. In a big bowl mix the flour, salt, yeast, cinnamon and raisins together. Pour water into the bowl and using a spatula or a wooden spoon mix it until well incorporated.
2. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit on your counter or inside your unheated oven for 12 to 18 hours.
3. Lightly flour a piece of parchment paper. Turn the dough out onto it, folding it over on itself at least once while you do so. Quickly shape the dough into a round ball. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rise for 1 hour more.
4. Flour your hands really well and also sprinkle a bit of flour over the dough. With your floured hands gently remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a well floured work surface. Flatten the dough a little bit then sprinkle the brown sugar over the dough. Now fold the dough over itself a few times, to make the brown sugar blend a bit into the dough. Form the dough into a ball, use more flour if needed. Place the dough over a piece of parchment paper.
5. Remove dutch oven from the oven. Take the ball of dough with the parchment paper and drop it into the hot Dutch oven. Cover the pot with the lid and place it back in the oven.
6. Bake for 30 minutes with the lid on, after which remove the lid and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown. Remove the bread from the pot, it should fall out easily. Let cool completely before slicing into it and serving.
