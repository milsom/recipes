# One Hour (or so) Bagels

## Ingredients
* 265g or 1c + 2T beer (non-alchoholic works too)
* 475g or 4c bread flour 
* 12g or 2t  salt
* 10g or 2 1/2t sugar 
* 6g or 2t yeast 
* 60g or 3T molasses
* Sesame seeds or any other topping you like

## Directions
1. Warm up beer in a sauce pot over low heat until it reaches 100-105F. Remove from heat. 
2. Add the yeast/beer mixture into a bowl followed by flour, salt, and sugar. Mix as much as possible with a sturdy spoon until the spoon is no longer able to get through the dough. 
3. At this point, get your hand VERY wet and knead the dough by hand in the bowl for at least 5 minutes or until the dough doesn’t tear or shear when you give it a tug. 
4. Cover and allow to ferment for 25 minutes. 
5. Divide dough into 6 even pieces that are approx 125g each. 
6. Shape each piece by de-gasing slightly with your fingertips to create a thick rectangular piece. Fold the top half of the dough toward you, then begin to roll the dough to create about a 10” cigar shape that’s slightly tapered on each end. 
7. Wrap the length of dough around your palm so that the tapered ends overlap each other by about 3”. Squeeze the part of the dough that’s overlapping firmly to press the ends together. Then, with the bagel still wrapped around your palm and fingers, roll the bagel back and forth on the overlapping seam to round it and further seal the dough. 
8. Place each shaped bagel on a parchment lined sheet tray and cover with another sheet tray or a clear sheet tray lid to proof for 15-20 minutes 
9. Bring a very large pot of water to a boil and Preheat your oven to 475F
10. Before boiling your bagels, whisk the molasses into the water. Drop 3 bagels into the water and boil for no more than 30 seconds on each side. Use a spider strainer or long slotted spoon to remove bagels from the water and place on a wire rack to drain. Load in the second batch of bagels and repeat. 
11. Place sesame seeds or other topping of choice in a bowl and press one side of bagels into toppings to coat well. After coating all bagels with toppings, place topping side up on a parchment lined sheet tray. 
12. Bake at 475F and bake for 15-17 minutes. When done they should be golden brown and toasty.
