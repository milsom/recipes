# Rustic Bread

## Poolish Ingredients
* 150g flour
* 150g water (room temp)
* 1 small pinch yeast

Let the poolish ripen on the counter 4-24 hours, preferably at least 16.

## Dough Ingredients
* 280g water (98f)
* 2g or 1/2 tsp yeast 
* all of the poolish 
* 350g all purpose flour
* 50g whole wheat flour
* 10g kosher salt

## Directions
1. Stir the water, yeast, and poolish with your finger to incorporate, then mix in the rest of the ingredients with a big spoon until you canâ€™t use the spoon anymore then wet your hands and squeeze the dough through your hands for about 2 minutes moving the bowl round and round as you go. All you are doing is combining the ingredients. The dough strength will come later in the folding process. Keep your hands wet. When finished cover with a plastic wrap and let it stand for 30 minutes.

2. Wet your hands now for the tuck and fold.  Reach in and pull the dough over itself. Pull it up until it is about to break. Do these nine or ten times. Then do the slap and fold six or seven times You are trying to make the dough into a nice tight round ball. Let stand another 30 minutes.

3. Repeat the folding as mentioned above. This will make the dough nice and strong.
Wrap the bowl in plastic and leave to ferment for one more hour. After that hour the dough should look bubbly and alive and really buoyant. 

4. Shape the loaf by pulling and tucking three or four times. Then create tension by rotating and pulling the loaf across the board. Then grab opposing sides and do a criss-cross tuck repeating three or four times then flip it over. Then create tension again by pulling and turning the dough across the board.
Leave on the counter in a large bowel lined with a floured kitchen cloth for 30-50 minutes to rise, preheating a Dutch Oven at 485-500.

5. Bake at 485 covered for 18 minutes, and 485 uncovered for additional 25-30 depending on oven and desired colour.
