# Ice Brew

## Ingredients
* 20 grams coffee, medium-coarse grind
* 200 grams water around 94C 
* 2 carafes (or jars): 1 empty carafe and 1 carafe with 150-200 grams of ice

## Directions
1. Place your dripper on the empty carafe, wet your filter paper, and add 20 grams of coffee; discard water used to wet filter paper.
2. Begin one long slow pour. Pour all 200 grams of water over the coffee in about 30 seconds, Coffee should take ~1 minute to filter
3. Once coffee is filtered into carafe, place the dripper with used grounds on top of the second carafe - the one with ice in it.
4. Then in 2 or 3 pours, pour 50 grams of the freshly brewed coffee with each pour into the dripper that still has the coffee grounds in it. The coffee will filter through the grounds into the carafe with ice. This should take about 1.5 minutes. (note for adjustment, more pour for more strength, less pour for less strength, you can also dump the whole thing back in one pour as well)
